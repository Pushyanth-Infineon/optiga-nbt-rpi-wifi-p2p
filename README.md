This is a sample project to use OPTIGA NBT in raspberry Pi 4/5 devices.


## Setup and requirements
This section contains information on how to setup and interface the OPTIGAâ„¢ Authenticate NBT with Raspberry Pi.

### Hardware requirements
1. Raspberry Pi 4/5
2. OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield

**Table 1. Mapping of the OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield's pins to Raspberry Pi**

| OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield | Raspberry Pi | Function |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| SDA                           | GPIO 2        | I2C data                   |
| SCL                           | GPIO 3        | I2C clock                  |
| IRQ                           | NC        | Interrupt                  |
| 3V3                           | 3V3                     | Power and pad supply (3V3) |
| GND                           | GND                     | Common ground reference    |

The Raspberry Pi's pins need to be connected to the OPTIGA&trade; Authenticate NBT Development Shield as shown in Table 1.

### Modify confirguration file
To change the I2C speed and baudrate on a Raspberry Pi, you need to modify the `config.txt` file. The I2C interface on the Raspberry Pi can be configured to operate at different speeds by setting appropriate parameters in this file.
1. Open the `config.txt` file located in the `/boot` directory.
```sh
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
2. To set the I2C speed, you need to add or modify the dtparam entry for the I2C bus. The parameter `i2c_arm_baudrate` is used to set the baud rate for the ARM I2C interface.

Note: The I2C clock frequency cannot be changed dynamically in Raspberry Pi with i2c-dev driver. So setting the clock frequency using ```ifx_i2c_set_clock_frequency``` will not have any effect and returns success.
```sh
# Enable I2C interface
dtparam=i2c_arm=on

#Set I2C speed
dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
```
3. After saving the confirguration file, reboot the system for changes to take effect.

### Toolset
`CMake`, `GCC` and `Make` tools are required for compiling and building software projects from source on Linux platform..

```sh
#Update the package list first
sudo apt-get update

#Install the toolset
sudo apt-get install cmake gcc make
```

# Overview

The program will perform the following:
 - Select Type 4 Tag application
 - Select application with File ID: E1A1 and length = 1
 - Write one byte (0xEE) to the file.
 - Read back one byte from the file.

## CMake build system

To build this project, configure CMake and use `cmake --build` to perform the compilation.
Here are the detailed steps for compiling and installing as library:

```sh
# 1. Change to the directory where the project is located:
cd path/to/repository

# 2. Create a build folder in the root path 
mkdir build
cd build

# 3. Run CMake to configure the build system
cmake -S ..

# 4. Build the code
cmake --build .

# 5. The executable will be present in the build folder. Run the executable
./nbt-rpi
```
